# Directory structure

This structure keeps the pages organized and makes URLs easy to understand.

```text
└── public/
    ├── css/
    │   └── style.css
    ├── images/         <-- These subdirectories will take shape as we add images.
        ├── attractions      They won't be visible to users, so they should be designed to be
        ├── shop             convenient for developers.
    │   └── ...
    ├── index.html
    ├── attractions/          <-- We won't make this page, but it is good for navigation
        ├── attraction1.html  <-- Replace this with the name of the attraction, e.g., `splash-ride.html`
        ├── attraction2.html
    │   └── ...
    └── shop/
        └── index.html
        ├── product1.html  <-- If we had product pages, they would go here
        ├── product2.html
    │   └── ...

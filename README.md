## Development

All commands should be run from the project root.

### Install development tools

To install the development tools, run:

```console
yarn install
```

### View the site

To view the website in a browser, run:

```console
yarn start
```

If your browser doesn't open automatically, start your browser and visit http://localhost:4040 or http://127.0.0.1:4040.

### Check code quality

Check CSS, HTML, and JavaScript:

```console
yarn run lint
```

Or check them individually:

```console
yarn run lint:css
yarn run lint:html
yarn run lint:js

```

Add `:fix` to any of the above commands to automatically fix some style issues. Example:

```console
yarn run lint:css:fix
```
